Theme: Death is only the beginning

To most people, Fly is an arcade character who dodges weights, arrows, and buzz saws for as long as possible to get a high score. What they don't realize is that Fly's real struggle lies after his death, when the game RESETS!!! All of the obstacles begin travelling backward and Fly must dodge them all over again. The stakes are higher here because if Fly fails, the game will crash and machine will be very sad. Can you help Fly go through the dreadful reset process?

Controls:
Move - WASD, Arrows, and Left Stick
Pause - Escape and Controller Start

Reset was made in about a day with all assets being made by me (for better or for worse).
